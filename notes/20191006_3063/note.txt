Text: Finally after five years I made it to the London Film Festival this weekend. I went to see the London premi√®re for Rialto (trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NKTbmqqINs) which is set in and around Dublin Port. Feeding into my Irish heritage, I'm inclined to watch pretty much anything filmed on location in Ireland. The director, Peter Mackie Burns, came along too for a Q&amp;A afterward which made from some interesting insights into how the characters were cast and a strong focus on cinematography.
