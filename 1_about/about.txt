Text:

I'm a web accessibility specialist, making the web a better, more inclusive place. I code, write and speak publicly about web accessibility, user research, performance and front-end technologies.

## Experienced with

- Accessibility-first approach to website design
- Conducting accessibility audits: manual testing with screen readers and automated tools like AXE and Lighthouse
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript (vanilla, or with a library or framework like Vue or React)
- Build systems like Gulp, Grunt and Webpack
- Components-based approach to front-end development with tools like Fractal and Pattern Lab
- Working in teams with tools including Slack, Trello and good old fashioned speaking to each other: face-to-face or by video call!
- Agile-based workflow and time estimations

## Previously

Before transitioning into the web industry I studied for four years at Brunel University London: completing a BSc in Multimedia Technology & Design. Over the past ten years I've helped deliver websites for a variety of clients in the private and public sectors.

## Seen me at an event recently?

I actively support and engage in the web community through regularly attending conferences and meetups that improve my awareness of new front-end technologies, web standards, accessibility and better approaches to user experience design.

## Speaking and publications

From time to time I do public speaking at events and publish posts about topics related to accessibility, usability and the web here on my blog. I've given talks previously at events including London Web Standards , Front-end London, UX Brighton and Internet Explorers Kent.

## My leisure

Some of the things I enjoy beyond my work include road cycling, visiting museums and travelling the world.
