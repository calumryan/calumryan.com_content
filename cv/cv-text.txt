## Profile
I'm a front-end developer with design experience building on ten years working in the web industry and my earlier university achievements in multimedia technology study.

My aim is to make the web a better place for all, with particular focus on inclusive design that caters for all types of disability. I look to work with people and organisations that align with this ambition and value the importance of having a great user experience in the web.

## Team work
I greatly value communication and wellbeing in teams and continually look for ways these can be improved: for instance, when a team member is working remotely or has just joined the organisation, and needs to be supported. I recognise and appreciate that we may all have different ways of communicating ideas, opinions and feedback which presents both challenges and opportunities when working in a team.

## Technical skills
Beyond my core front-end skills of writing semantic HTML, CSS and presentational JavaScript, with ES6, I have some experience in writing web applications in VueJs, React and PHP. I’m very familiar with popular frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap but also comfortable with writing my own templating libraries/styleguides using component-focused tools like [Fractal](https://fractal.build/).

## Accessibility
When I’m approaching a project I prioritise making it accessible to all. It matters most to me that anyone with one or multiple impairments, situational, temporary or permanent, can use the website without hindrance or frustration. I look to achieve this through adherence to well constructed semantic code,  WCAG 2.1 Standards compliance and extensive user testing, conversation and feedback.

## Beyond the office
Both managing and delivering a project, I seek first to understand what problems or challenges a user faces when using a feature. From this I identify specific user stories and features which can be researched, designed and developed. I like to plan projects based on features, rather than activities. Ideally they should have short iterations, that offer the opportunity to get user feedback as the feature is developed.

## IndieWeb
I also participate in the IndieWeb community. Here there’s a strong emphasis on building open-source, user-focused web technologies, building and maintaining your own website along with sharing knowledge and ideas.
