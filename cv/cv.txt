I'm a certified Web Accessibility Specialist, currently working full-time as an Interaction Designer for dxw making the web a better, more inclusive place. I code, write and speak publicly about web accessibility, user research, performance and front-end technologies.

## Experienced with

- Accessibility-first approach to website design
- Conducting accessibility audits: manual testing with screen readers and automated tools like AXE and Lighthouse
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript (vanilla, or with a library or framework like Vue or React)
- Working in teams with tools including Slack, Trello and good old fashioned speaking to each other: face-to-face or by video call!
- Agile-based workflow and time estimations

## Previously

Before transitioning into the web industry I studied for four years at Brunel University London: completing a BSc in Multimedia Technology & Design. Over the past ten years I've helped deliver websites for a variety of clients in the private and public sectors.
