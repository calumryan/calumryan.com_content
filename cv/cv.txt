## Profile

I'm a self-motivated web developer with design experience building on ten years working in the web industry and my earlier university achievements in multimedia technology study.

My aim is to make the web a better place for all, with particular focus on inclusive design that caters for all types of disability. I look to work with people and organisations that align with this ambition and value the importance of having a great user experience in the web.

## Team work

I greatly value communication and wellbeing in teams and continually look for ways these can be improved: for instance, when a team member is working remotely or has just joined the organisation, and needs to be supported. I recognise and appreciate that we may all have different ways of communicating ideas, opinions and feedback which presents both challenges and opportunities when working in a team.

## Technical skills

Beyond my core front-end skills of writing semantic HTML, CSS and presentational JavaScript, with ES6, I have some experience in writing web applications in VueJs, React and PHP. I’m very familiar with popular frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap but also comfortable with writing my own templating libraries/styleguides using component-focused tools like [Fractal](https://fractal.build/).

## Accessibility
When I’m approaching a project I always try to prioritise making it accessible to all. It matters most to me that anyone with one or multiple impairments, temporary or permanent, can use the website without hindrance or frustration. I look to achieve this through adherence to well constructed semantic code and extensive user testing, conversation and feedback.

## Beyond the office
Both managing and delivering a project, I seek first to understand what problems or challenges a user faces when using a feature. From this I identify specific user stories and features which can be researched, designed and developed. I like to plan projects based on features, rather than activities. Ideally they should have short iterations, that offer the opportunity to get user feedback as the feature is developed.

## IndieWeb
I also participate in the IndieWeb community. Here there’s a strong emphasis on building open-source, user-focused web technologies, building and maintaining your own website along with sharing knowledge and ideas. I organise a fortnightly event, enabling people from a range of backgrounds and abilities to work on improving their personal websites.
