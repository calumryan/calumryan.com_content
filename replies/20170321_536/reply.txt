Text: Agree with this mainly but unsure of a native application solution. I would like to plan a discussion (maybe at a future IndieWebCamp) on emergence of Progressive Web Apps to further enhance the user experience on the web offline as much as online; with native app-like interaction, re-engagement with things like push notifications. All such things start to bring us much more inline with the merits you speak of in regard of popular silos.
