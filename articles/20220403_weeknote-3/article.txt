Hello friends and followers,

The past week flew by and here I am late on Sunday trying to finish off my third week note without fail.

## Comedy
The week began with an unplanned visit to the Soho Theatre. I was immensely pleased to snap up one of the re-released tickets for the sold out Mulberry with (link: https://www.timkey.co.uk/ text: Tim Key). I can fully endorse The Times' recommendation that this is:

> "The greatest stand-up response to Lockdown so far"

Also, surprisingly I was blessed with a front-row seat which inevitably put me in the frontline for some audience participation! I was the perfect choice for Mulberry's storyline, being stuffed up the in Lockdown One as a lone male in a confined space. Tim Key did not disappoint, and I even got a free beer out of it!

## Tonbridge Digital

## TV and streaming
Viewing included catching up with the latest series of Masterchef, Have I Got News for You, and the latest video from (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUJxXkZeiE4 text: Daily Bald exploring Soviet treasures in Georgia). I also finally got round to watching BAFTA award-winning (link: https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfilm/films/after-love text: After Love). By far one of my favourite films of recent years!

## Hastings
On Saturday my parent came to visit to help with some pre-sale work on the flat. We also fitted in some relaxation time for a visit to Hastings and enjoyed a delicious meze-based lunch at (link: http://restaurantwebx.com/Isabella/ text: Isabella) in Hastings Old Town along with especially strong Turkish coffee. Top tip for cost-free parking in Hastings on a dry day: pick yourself a quiet, unrestricted road just off Brisco's Walk and stroll into town from there, less than a mile away.

Until next week folks, stay safe and look after yourselves!
