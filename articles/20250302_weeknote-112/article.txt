Title: Weeknote 112

Text:

- The past couple of weeks haven't been terribly pleasant healthwise, with a rather lengthy time battling the flu. After a few days off work, I've been slowly catching up and gently easing back in to exercise to help reduce muscular pains that kept me from having a good night's sleep.
- Observing from a far, the living nightmare of a Trump/Musk administration in the US that this weekend saw the complete firing of our counterparts working in the US equivalent of GDS.
- Friday, I joined Ximena for a late-Valentine's dinner to make up missing it due to illness. Our first choice venue was too full, so we headed to Islington's (link: https://littlegeorgia.co.uk/ text: Little Georgia restaurant) for some delicious Georgian food, where there was thankfully a table free.
- Saturday night we headed to the Royal Festival Hall for a Tchaikovsky concert by the London Symphony Orchestra, plus some music from Mahler. A thoroughly enjoyable performance, enhanced by the unique perspective of our seats positioned directly behind the choir.
- Sunday I cycled out to Richmond Park under clear skies and paid a visit to Cycle Exchange, Kingston, which was rather busy and lacking many cakes or pastries. Nevertheless, the coffee there is good and great to get out on the bike for the first time since November.
