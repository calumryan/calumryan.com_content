Title: Weeknote 74

----

Text:

- Last weekend was rather unpleasantly interrupted by a stomach bug that lingered for three days. I pretty much lost all appetite and felt quite feverish at times.
- This weekend was thankfully a little more pleasant. I managed to fit in a short solo hike near Dorking in the Surrey Hills. There I discovered the remains of a training trench used by Polish soldiers in WW2.
- My big trip to Chile is fast approaching, with precious few days to prepare what I'm going to take with me. It's quite a few years since I flew long-haul, so feeling a mixture of excitement and anxiety over the experience of spending so long on a crowded plane.
- All going well with the flight, stay tuned next week for my first ever weeknote written from the Southern Hemisphere!
