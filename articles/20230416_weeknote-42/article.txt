## Pizza road trip
My week started off on Bank Holiday Monday with a road trip joining my uni friend to tour Surrey's best pizza restaurants. Since last April, my friend and I started going in search of the best pizza restaurants London and beyond has to offer. Our winner of the three restaurants visited in this single road trip was (link: https://monteforte.co.uk/ text: Reigate's Monte Forte) which did an authentic Neapolitan style pizza. Next stop for our pizza road trip, Naples! ðŸ™ƒ

## More furniture news
Back at home with the help of X, I've been busy taking delivery of more new furniture for my new home. This week, my sofa-bed arrived. I'd a local carpenter modify my giant-sized IKEA Ekedalen bar table down to a more comfortable height for anybody of average height. After next week, I should finally have the new wardrobe and drawers I've ordered to finally move everything out of boxes since my move last month.

## To Germany
Once again, I made my way to DÃ¼sseldorf by train ahead of (link: https://beyondtellerrand.com/ text: Beyond Tellerrand) conference starting next week. On my way there, I made a detour and stopoff to Aachen due to track work closures. It made for a pleasant lunch stop to sample the local speciality bratwurst on a slight detour from my flexitarian habits of the past. 

Await next week's news of my trip to Bucharestâ€¦!
