Title: Weeknote 98

----

Text:

- Midweek I stayed in Manchester for a 1-day accessibility event aimed at people working across the UK's public sector, with around 60 in attendance. It was a relatively short event of around 4-hours but filled with interesting talks. They included a talk about the differences of Neurodiversity versus being Neurodivergent, running an accessibility assurance review, plus some general discussion about the challenges of leading on accessibility in large organisations.
- I'd quite a lot of spare time in Manchester to look around. I hopped on the Metrolink tram out to Salford Quays, curious to see how much it had changed since I last visited in 2011. (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peel_Group text: The Peel Group) has certainly made its mark on the area at Media City, surrounded by towering blocks of apartments, BBC Manchester and ITV Studios.
- On my short visit to Manchester, I visited both an upmarket pie restaurant for lunch and a Vietnamese restaurant for dinner before my train back. Neither were worthy of note in my opinion and a little overpriced.
- I've been kept quite busy at work, overseeing some significant projects on different teams and further planning and promotion of accessibility training across GOV.UK.
- On Saturday I'd a minor accident with my racing bicycle as I approached the North Downs and slid on a cattle grid at slow speed. Fortunately, I picked up just a slightly strained finger, plus some bruises and grazes, so was able to cycle back home without too much pain.
