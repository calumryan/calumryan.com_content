Title: Weeknote 101

Text:

- At work I've been putting together a plan for running an accessibility champions network to share with senior leaders. There's a fair amount of activity across all the teams I'm working with currently, that's becoming somewhat difficult to keep track of for various reasons, inconsistent communication approaches being one.
- On Thursday I attended (link: https://techsharepro.performedia.com/ text: Techshare Pro) conference hosted by HSBC in Canary Wharf. Rather more corporate than what I'm used to at other conferences I attend! It was a sold out event with a good mix of attendees from both the public and private sector working in accessibility. All the sessions were panel-based with many topics of close interest to me including, running a champions network, a discussion about burnout for accessibility specialists, and accessibility leadership challenges.
- Saturday I managed to get outside for a cycle ride round Richmond Park, almost a month without cycling! I met up with an old colleague from dxw for lunch at a nearby cycling café, (link: http://www.the-dynamo.co.uk/ text: The Dynamo). The menu was a little pricey, but the café had a good atmosphere, food and coffee, plus somewhere to park the bike inside.
