For my challenge I'm focusing on getting an open-source project finished and ready for others to help contribute to that I started at IndieWebCamp earlier this year.

You can track progress on my [Github repository](https://github.com/calumryan/indieweb/commits/master). With the exception of a couple of commitments over the festive period I plan to push something there every day this month. Begining the month I registered the domain for my project [indiewebguides.org](https://indiewebguides.org/). So far this month I've reworked the UI, drafted some content for the guides and resolved some accessibility issues.

I also have another IndieWeb-related tool in the early stages of development which is an IndieWeb component library inspired by [Paul Robert Lloyd's](https://paulrobertlloyd.com/) component library for [24 ways](https://github.com/24ways/frontend) based on [Fractal](https://fractal.build/).
