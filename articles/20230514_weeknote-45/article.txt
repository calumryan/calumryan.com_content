## Furniture fun
Finally, almost a month since being delivered a collection of new bedroom furniture which turned out to have the wrong parts, a courier turned up, to take it all back to JD Williams (avoid!). Thankfully through some coincidence, and a generous friend of X, I was able to find an alternative fabulous looking wardrobe for free in a short space of time, less the cost of having it transported. My bedroom is finally feeling more organised and more liveable, two months since moving in!

## Green oasis
The green themed highlights of the week were my first visit to East London's Columbia Road Flower Market for new plants to fill my new home with, preceded by brunch at a rare Chilean caf√© located in Paddington's Harrison's Coffee. X and I shared a divine culinary experience, trying palta (crushed avocado) with marraqueta (a dangerously addictive soft bread roll), and possibly the best Chilean (link: https://www.thespruceeats.com/chilean-style-beef-empanadas-3029728 text: pino empanada) I've tried this side of the ocean with a spicy pebre condiment.

## Eurovision
Back in Wimbledon for Eurovision final night I cooked up a favourite lentil dahl recipe of mine for X, which combined red lentils and roasted aubergine, plus a fresh mint raita. I was glad to see Liverpool didn't disappoint in hosting Eurovision on Ukraine's behalf this year, and echos of the city's rich music scene past and present. Not surprised to see that the waffle/toasty maker effort from Sweden won, a decent song overall.
