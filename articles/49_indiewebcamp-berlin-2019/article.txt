## Organisers
The focus of IndieWebCamps is, as always, a volunteer-run event with no attendance fee, aimed at bringing together people to discuss, share and create to advance the independent web. As a volunteer I took the opportunity to look at ways we could improve the future planning and facilitation of IndieWebCamps including better information about the accessibility of events and overall facilitation.

## Day 1 - discussions
On the discussions day we started as usual with intros and demos from all the attendees as well as a keynote by [Yulia](https://twitter.com/ioctaptceb) on her past experience as a first-time attendee and organiser. We then moved on to session planning: inviting everyone to propose a session, if they wanted to, and add it to the session grid.

Before commencing sessions everyone was invited to split into small discussion groups and head out to different places for lunch. I decided to join the group going to helloGoodPie, where we had a discussion on creating a social network for the IndieWeb.

Suitably warmed-up and fuelled with opening discussion and food, we returned for the first sessions of the afternoon. I went to ***One Click IndieWeb Setup for Wordpress***, facilitated by [David Shanske](https://david.shanske.com/), who demonstrated the range of IndieWeb features and plugins that can be set up in WordPress with relative simplicity.

Next up I attended the session ***All Things Auth*** where we discussed [IndieAuth](https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth) and all matters related to authenticating yourself on the web. IndieAuth is an extension to find authorization endpoints in a website layered on top of [OAuth](https://indieweb.org/OAuth).

After that I went to ***All Things Pictures*** where we discussed and shared our approaches to publishing images on our websites. There are many variations in approaches depending on what kind of CMS or framework people have for their website. Syndicating posts out to platforms like Twitter or pulling them in from Instagram with single or multiple images can pose different challenges due to unpredictable API changes.

Leading on from that I went to the ***Storing + Sharing Bookmarks*** session. Again, as with pictures, there are many variations in approaches to bookmarking dependent on what setup people have. Whilst some people store bookmarks with third-party services, like Delicious or Pinboard, others have self-built solutions for not only storing but publicly sharing and endorsing bookmarks between each other.

In the final session for the day I went to [Ian Forrester's](https://cubicgarden.com/) session titled ***How can the Indieweb help the public service internet?!***. Ian's background in working with BBC Research & Development gave us some helpful perspective on how using OpenWeb authentication could be applied to the internet-based services provided by public service broadcasters, like the BBC, rather than just copying approaches by the commercial providers.

## Day 2 - making
Back for the second day some of us, but not everyone, made it along for the making day in which attendees work together or independently to get things working on their websites. I had a couple of things to check off my list of improvements and tweaks. First something that I needed to do was add an extra field for alternative image descriptions to my hand-rolled CMS and templates.

I caught up with [Chanel](https://fumanity.com/) whom I'd met briefly the last time I was in Berlin. It was her first time at an IndieWebCamp so I gave her a few pointers on where to get started.

Having spent a couple of hours tweaking my CMS I then proceeded to make changes to how I display my events page. This includes associated materials like presentations and conferences I've attended or will be attending. To do all of this was a big task which I didn't manage to finish though I did learn more about implementing the [Leaflet Js library](https://leafletjs.com/) in order to display a map of my events coverage. I managed to retrieve my [archived Lanyrd profile](https://web.archive.org/web/20140703192722/http://lanyrd.com/profile/calumryan/) so as to give me some ideas for content and overall design.

Furthermore I relaunched a documentation project, [IndieWebGuides](https://indiewebguides.org/), I've been working on for the past couple of years using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io) to build it. It's still very much a work in progress without a lot of content but I'm happier with the new content architecture I've built and designed for it. I hope over time to encourage others to [contribute to it through GitHub](https://github.com/calumryan/indieweb-guides) and provide prominence to well written articles about the IndieWeb elsewhere.

## Final thoughts
All in all I'm pleased I was able to attend IndieWebCamp Berlin once more and get the opportunity to see past and new attendees all with different perspectives and experiences to contribute to the IndieWeb. It's great to see plenty of [future IndieWebCamps planned](https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps#Upcoming_IndieWebCamps) here in Europe both continuing in previous locations and a couple of new ones in the Netherlands and UK for 2019!
