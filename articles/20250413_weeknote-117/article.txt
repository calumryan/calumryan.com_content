Title: Weeknote 117

- On Wednesday, I cycled to the office for the first time to compare how long the journey would take compared to taking the train. Door to door, it took roughly 40 minutes, plus an extra 15 minutes to get changed and head back out again for a coffee. I might do it occasionally, but I’m not planning to make cycling to work a regular thing.
- Also on Wednesday, I'd the opportunity to attend my first "Talks at 10 Downing Street" event. I feel really fortunate that, through my job, I have access to such unique experiences, especially in a venue that most people would rarely have the chance to visit. Former MP and current Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A), Tristram Hunt, shared insights about his career, future plans at the new V&A in East London and his particular interests in urban history and the Victorian era.
- At work, the accessibility audit report finally arrived in my inbox last week, so I've been rather busy reading through all 200+ pages of it and making sense of it all.
- Over the weekend, I played the role of tech support and setup assistant for my parents, who were visiting with their new MacBooks. Thankfully, everything went reasonably well with the setup, and we'd time to visit Mena for some delicious toasties at (link: https://www.thedustyknuckle.com/ text: The Dusty Knuckle) in Harringay.
- Sunday, I headed out early once again with my cycling buddy for a 35-mile ride to Windsor via Honesty Tally Ho Farm café, then hopped on the train back just in time to catch the nearby Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race on TV.
