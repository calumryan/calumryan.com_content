Title: Weeknote 25

Text:

‚Ä¶UK government (obviously).
‚Ä¶being alone.
‚Ä¶feeling the odd one out of my generation.
‚Ä¶wishing I'd done things differently years ago.
‚Ä¶living in a place I don't feel is or ever was really right for me.
‚Ä¶handling the uncertainties of my house sale going through.
‚Ä¶shutting down mentally when I can't handle more than one big life event.
‚Ä¶battling with my self-consciousness to maintain friendships.

They'll be better times ahead. I never give up hope and determination to get through these tough times, to improve myself and overall be a better person on the inside and outside.
