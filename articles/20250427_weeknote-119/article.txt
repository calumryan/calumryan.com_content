Title: Weeknote 119

Text:

- At home I now have a planter box for my balcony custom made by my friend, Luis. The weather has been very pleasant for the remainder of April, albeit lacking much rain for the plants.
- Sad to see yet more trees being cut down along the banks of the nearby Wandle river.
- I've been making an effort to cycle more, taking advantage of the sunny evenings and weekends to stay fit. On Friday, I tackled my first cross-London ride to visit Mena and the cat. The journey was somewhat stressful, with heavy traffic for much of the way, and a fair share of Lime bike riders weaving unpredictably, seemingly oblivious to their surroundings.
- Sunday I decided to cover new ground on my bicycle by taking the train north to Cambridgeshire. I recently discovered a website to help me plan new routes with quieter, more scenic routes. Along my way I stopped off for coffee at The Nook, Swavesey, before continuing to pretty St Ives via the disused Cambridge to Oxford railway. This is now a combined cycleway and bus-only guided route.
