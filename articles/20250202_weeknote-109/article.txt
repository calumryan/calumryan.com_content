Title: Weeknote 109

----

Text:

- Work this week was mostly some ad hoc requests for accessibility advice and reviewing some additions for the upcoming app for GOV.UK, which was announced last week by Peter Kyle. 
- CO2 levels didn't seem good at the office when I went in on Thursday, to the point I'd to step outside for 30 minutes. Beside the long, crowded commute, it's just another reason I prefer to work from home most days.
- The one upside of my venture to the office was a visit to Kova Patisserie as a precursor/alternative for leaving-do drinks of a colleague.
- I've been busy preparing for my short solo Spanish trip next weekend to a new destination, more of which I'll have to show and say about in my next weeknote.
- At the weekend I said goodbye to Bagheera who's returned to her North London home. We had to take her back via a longer, more complex route overground than before due to railway closures, which unfortunately made it a rather more stressful experience for the small black cat. 
- Sunday I joined Ximena for a look round a flea market in East London, where we snapped up a few bargains for her home and spotted many a cute dog with their owners. 
- At the nearby Olympic Park for many years we had a delicious Italian lunch at Gotto Trattoria. Pleasant memories evoked of my time there back in 2012 to see the Paralympics, albeit the place looks very different now!
