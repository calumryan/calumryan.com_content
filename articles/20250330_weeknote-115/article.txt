Title: Weeknote 115

Text:

- Earlier this week, I bid farewell to my kindest neighbour and her lovely dog as they prepare to leave London ðŸ˜¢.
- Hoping to use the extra hours of evening daylight to do some cycling circuits of nearby Richmond Park after work.
- I noticed my new Lib Dem MP, Paul Kohler, in the news recently, addressing Parliament on the 6-year-old issue regarding South West Railways. Despite promises, theyâ€™ve only introduced a handful of the new Arterio trains, leaving the decades-old fleet still struggling on to serve southwest London without air conditioning, toilets, or enough capacity during busy times.
- I attended (link: https://stateofthebrowser.com text: State of the Browser) conference on Saturday. Another great line up of talks and spoke bumped in to more than just a few familiar faces. Left feeling inspired and motivated to write a talk of my own soon.
- Spent some time Sunday walking round Regent's Park and Primrose Hill before discovering another food stall in nearby Camden market that sells Columbian arepas, nom!
- On my TV viewing list currently, a couple of new travel themed programs from Michael Portillo, including his new Portugal show on C5 and Great Continental Railway Journeys on BBC. Glad to see Race Across the World is coming back soon.
