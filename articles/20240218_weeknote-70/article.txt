Title: Weeknote 70

Text:

- Some unexpected news at work about our client running out of money to pay us put a slight dampener on the week. Hoping it will be a temporary situation, but I'm yet to find out what I might be working on in the next month or so.
- We went to Manchester last weekend to visit some friends for their kids' birthday party. Ahead of the party we spent some time in the city exploring. We came across a popular Vietnamese restaurant we had to queue for and later made a visit to (link: https://www.feelgoodclub.co/ text: Feel Good Club) for coffee and cake.
- At home we've invested in a treadmill from Decathlon that seems pretty solid and reliable so far, plus it works with my Zwift app. This adds to our home gym, which so far consists of a Wahoo turbo trainer for indoor cycling. 
- I met up for the first time with a local dog and his owner from BorrowMyDoggy site. This one was quite an energetic Golden Labrador puppy. The pup was quite a handful, but all went well and considering whether I'll do more walks with him in the coming weeks.
- At the cinema we saw (link: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13238346/ text: Past Lives) which is up there in terms of my Korean film favourites that I've see over the past few years.
- There was some major disruption over the weekend on the main rail route through Wimbledon that forced us to divert on to the misery line aka the Northern Line via Tooting to reach Central London. That route always seems to be a draining, noisy, overcrowded experience. If only Crossrail 2 were built!
- Amongst the not so cheery notes, I'm grateful for the first signs of Spring here in London that's hopefully not to be followed be a second spell of wintry conditions.
