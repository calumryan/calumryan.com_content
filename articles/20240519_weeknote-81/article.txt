- Sadly I hadn't the time or energy to visit (link: https://beyondtellerrand.com/ text: Beyond Tellerrand) and (link: https://indieweb.org/ text: IndieWebCamp) taking place in Dusseldorf this year. From what I ready on my Mastodon feed it looked like yet another great event, so looking forward to when the video recordings come out.
- Back at work I finally saw the launch of one of my proudest pieces of work to date, the (link: https://www.dxw.com/2024/05/dxw-accessibility-manual/ text: dxw Accessibility Manual).
- Midweek after work I decided to take a stroll over to nearby Broadway Market Tooting for dinner and pleasantly surprised by the choice on offer. I settled on a (link: https://kiaanspanasian.com/ text: Kiaan's Pan Asian Street Food) after persuasion by the owner to come in try their 50% off all food offer. I had the dumplings for starter and bao buns for main. Both were delicious and tempted to take Ximena and friends there again sometime.
