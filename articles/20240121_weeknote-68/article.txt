Title: Weeknote 68

Text:

- Most of the week was spent in the cosy comfort of home over what seemed to be the coldest period of the year yet.
- On Monday I joined Ximena for celebration mini empanadas, tacos, and churros at (link: http://london.mestizomx.com/ text: Mestizo) Mexican Restaurant. Possibly the best Mexican food I've tried yet!
- On Thursday I ventured out in to the icy conditions to head for the office to join a colleague for their leaving drinks, followed by a delicious warming dinner of Vietnamese Pho at (link: https://senviet.has.restaurant/ text: Sen Viet).
- On Saturday I strolled along Regents Canal towards Camden and Kentish Town via Primrose Hill.
- Along my way I stopped off for food at Camden Lock food market which has a semi-indoor spot for informal sit-down dining. I had a delicious spicy calzone there.
- I discovered (link: https://doppiocoffee.co.uk/ text: Doppio) in Kentish Town which has great coffee and a spacious unstuffy environment to enjoy it in surrounded almost every kind of coffee making equipment you can think of.
- These short, cold days of British winter aren't the most enticing for travelling anywhere far outside the hustle and bustle of London, but looking forward to planning some day trips later in the year.
