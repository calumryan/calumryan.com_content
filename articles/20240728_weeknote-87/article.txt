Title: Weeknote 87

Text:

- On Thursday, I managed to acquire a ticket to see (link: https://www.bbc.co.uk/proms text: The Proms) for the first time at the Royal Albert Hall. The BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra performed Brahms’s Third Symphony and Schoenberg’s Verklärte Nacht, followed by mezzo-soprano Alice Coote singing to Mahler’s Kindertotenlieder.
- The last half my week I developed a pain in my neck and shoulder, which is unfortunately persisting without improvement. I shall need to get more in to the routine of daily stretching and exercises, for sure!
- Friday evening I headed over to visit Ximena's new home in North London for homemade pizza and to watch the Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony together. It was a great shame the weather conditions weren't favourable for Paris, and also not entirely sure the river-based parade of athletes came together as impressively as intended. Looking forward to seeing the upcoming cycling events. Already a silver for Anna Henderson in the time trial, who I remember watching as an upcoming pro-cyclist just six years ago winning in the Tour Series at Stevenage.
