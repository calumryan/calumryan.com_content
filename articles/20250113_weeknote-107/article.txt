Title: Weeknote 107

Text:

- As expected the first week of the New Year for me back at work wasn't too busy with a lot of my colleagues still on leave.
- I've been spending the quiet periods between tasks seeing whether establishing an accessibility advocates network within the organisation is viable. It's slow take-up so far, and demanding much patience.
- I learnt just towards the end of the week of the recent tragic passing of a past GDS-er (link: https://www.vickyteinaki.com text: Vicky Teinaki). Although I never met or spoke to her, I share the view that I'm sure many others will that she was an inspiration for us all in the world of accessibility and user-centred design.
- At the weekend I travelled coast-bound to spend some time exploring a very sunny Hove and then walked over to Brighton. I quite like Hove, it has quite a few of the same cafes as in next door Brighton, only without the hoards of tourists.
