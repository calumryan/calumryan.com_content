## More home move preparations
Preparations to move are well underway, with my living room slowly accumulating full or half-full boxes. Most boxes remain unsealed until I've a confirmed date for exchange and completion. House move stress levels are gradually increasing day by day as my conveyancing process drags on yet another week. It's fair to say I'm generally not in my happiest or relaxed frame of mind currently.

## In the kitchen
The kitchen remains one part of my home where packing hasn't commenced just yet. Hence, all my kitchenware remains unpacked and the full menu of my weekly usual dishes remains, such as homemade pizza and Indian tapas. In addition, X has been helping me learn to cook up some Chilean additions for my menu, including (link: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopaipilla text: sopaipas) with a delicious topping of homemade (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebre text: pebre).

## Spa-themed weekend
To take my mind off all the stresses, over the weekend I went with X to visit the Tunbridge Wells Spa Railway for a steam train ride south to Eridge. The journey was a little under 30 minutes each way, with pleasant scenery along the way between Kent and Sussex. We paused for lunch and some locally produced alcoholic beverages at the cosy and very characterful (link: https://huntsmanpuberidge.co.uk/ text: Huntsman) pub. 

Concluding our Spa-themed weekend, we indulged in a visit to London's Old Hammam & Spa for a full Turkish body wash and foam massage. Feeling cleansed and somewhat more relaxed after that, ready to tackle another week of home move stress.
