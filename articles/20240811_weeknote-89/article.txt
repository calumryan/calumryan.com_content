Title: Weeknote 89

- Recently I signed up for Bluesky now that it's no longer by invite-only. Enjoying it while it lasts as a relatively non-toxic place to read posts from people who used to be active on X (formerly known as Twitter) a lot more, like myself. Fearful it won't be a forever platform, I've of course set up my website to syndicate content there alongside my Mastodon instance. Give me follow me if you like on Bluesky (link: https://bsky.app/profile/calumryan.com text: @calumryan.com)
- I discovered a great little Brazilian restaurant, (link: https://www.tastefactoryuk.com/ text: Taste Factory), inside Tooting Market with quite an extensive menu of South American food and drink that's all new to me. Perhaps one day I'll make it to visit Brazil too, but for now this'll do!
- With many of my colleagues at work away for the school holidays, it's been quite a slow period in my job trying to find the right people to get things approved and plan my workload for the next few months. It's given me some time to add to my bookshelf (link: https://www.matuzo.at/ text: Manuel Matuzovic)'s Web Accessibility Cookbook that I'm looking forward to reading to improve my knowledge on all things related to coding for accessibility.
- I said goodbye to Bagheera the cat who'd spent a few months living with me in SW19. She's now living in North London with Ximena and finally has her own garden again.
- On bank holiday here in the UK, Ximena and I visited the William Morris Gallery in Walthamstow. I was surprised by how pleasant the surroundings are, although you don't have to go far to find ugly apartment blocks, new and old, surrounded by unloved, litter strewn streets, much like most of London.
