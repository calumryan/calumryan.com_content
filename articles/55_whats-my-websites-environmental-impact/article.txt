## The stats
For this analysis I used [websitecarbon.com](https://websitecarbon.com). Every time a visitor comes to my website, without any cached version of it, the carbon footprint is just **0.52g of CO2** produced. My current host, Digital Ocean, doesn't appear to be using green energy which brings down the overall score to **72%**. Potentially with a host which uses green energy this could be improved by around **9%**.

## Performance gains
In terms of performance my website performs very well with a [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) score of 100%. Overall this helps reduce the energy consumption my website has for both the data centre and end user devices. The steps I took to achieve this score included:

- Switching to HTTP/2 for more efficient delivery of assets by loading them in parallel rather than one at a time.
- Compressing images to download and render more efficiently.
- Though only currently supported in Chrome, I implemented the `loading=lazy` attribute for images. This way the browser should only start loading image resources after more essential items like layout and text content.
- Using responsive images to load the most appropriate sized image for the available viewport space and, in some cases, available bandwidth.
- Implemented a ServiceWorker to cache parts of the website for repeat visits, therefore reducing the number of HTTP requests needed per repeat visit.
- Implemented a dark mode for users on supporting operating systems to reduce energy use when it's enabled.
- Switched to a newer more efficient version of PHP.

## Further reducing my website's environmental impact
Some other ways I might consider reducing the impact of my website on the environment include changing to a host that uses green energy. I could review the overall user experience of the website to see if there are ways to make it easier to navigate with fewer wasted page loads. Finally I could consider looking at using content delivery networks to load my website from locations closer to different users.
