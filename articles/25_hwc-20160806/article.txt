The whole day sprint event provided a good opportunity to spend a longer amount of time on developing/improving website features. It wasn't the same experience/approach as an IndieWebCamp. For today's event we went straight into practical work without presentations or discussions.

A small handful of us were in attendance and I made some good progress on designing and developing an <a href="/events">events section</a> for my website. This incorporates the <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">webmentions</a> functionality: providing the means for anyone to RSVP to public events e.g. Homebrew Website Club London.
