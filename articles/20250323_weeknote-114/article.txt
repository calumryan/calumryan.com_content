- At works it's been a busy period for me organising the audit and going to visit our supplier in South Wales to observe testing.
- Last week was also Services Week, and I had the chance to attend a session on service design patterns at the TPX Impact office, just down the road from my office in East London. As expected, the event was predominantly attended by service designers, which left me feeling slightly out of my depth during the networking prior to the talks.

This is the first role where I've been tasked with visiting a supplier and managing almost all the arrangements myself.

- We had a relaxing lunch at (link: https://lima-cantina.com/ text: Lima Cantina). I had the delicious ‘Pollo a la Brasa’ (Peruvian rotisserie chicken) served with Andean potatoes, aji amarillo, and huacatay cream, followed by some of the best picarones I've ever had, accompanied by coconut ice cream.
- Sunday, I went cycling with my friend Luis to a cyclists' café in Reigate, following a hilly route that truly tested my aerobic limits.
