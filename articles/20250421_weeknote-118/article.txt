- With Easter upon us, on Good Friday we went for lunch at Trevi Ristorante located next to Highbury and Islington. I’d the chicken Milanese topped with delicious bolognese and penne pasta. It’s a good place to go for reasonably priced Italian food in London with a rustic atmosphere.

- Saturday we headed to Yorkshire on the train and to visit Salts Mill in Saltaire. There was a new exhibition by David Hockney called 20 Flowers For 2025. Lunch at the Café Opera was decent, but it fell short in terms of service quality, value for money, and menu choices compared to what I had experienced three years ago.

- After spending Saturday night at the Leeds Novotel, we went to If Up North for brunch. The food was quite mediocre and felt overpriced for the portion size and quality. With most other places closed on Easter Sunday, we took the opportunity to explore the Corn Exchange. On a sunny day, it's a charming spot filled with independent shops offering everything from vintage clothing to souvenir posters and unique gifts.

- Luis has been helping me at home to enhance my balcony by adding a planter box and, hopefully, some plants that will thrive better than my previous effort at bringing greenery to the space two years ago.
