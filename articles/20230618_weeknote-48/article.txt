## Hampton Court Palace
For my post-birthday celebrations, I invited my mum and X to join me on a visit to Hampton Court Palace. The high admission price was a little hard to stomach, so we made every effort to see as much as possible of the palace, including its extensive gardens, over the course of an afternoon. Overall, I enjoyed it and was able to absorb the vast amount of history about the palace without feeling too overwhelmed.

## Work reflections
After three months of uncertainty at work about the future of my role there retaining some focus in accessibility, I finally had some clarity this past week about my future in the company. More news on that to come soon!

## Exhibitions 
Over the weekend, I returned to the annual fixture linked to my university, Brunel, which I graduated from in 2011 and exhibited at, (link: https://www.madeinbrunel.com/ text: Made in Brunel). As ever, an impressive array of work on show from the graduates of 2023. I also bumped in to my old course tutor there, Steve Cockett, who's still at the university. Somehow he doesn't look any more aged than way back in 2007 when I first met him to get a signature for my Macromedia student license application ahead of starting uni.

Also design-related, I joined X to visit The Design Museum to see Ai Weiwei's Making Sense exhibition, along with a contemporary sari exhibition named The Offbeat Sari. Both extremely thought-provoking exhibitions with a great deal of work put into their curation. Still one of my favourite museums ever visited!

## Doggy daycare
I'd the pleasure of looking after a neighbour's dog on Saturday. Their sweet, friendly and *very* energetic Dachshund, Coco, had a splendid day of attention with X and myself at home in Wimbledon, tennis ball games included. I'm all the more sure from the experience that I'd like my own canine friend one day soon.
