Title: Weeknote 6

The past week in the company of Covid wasn't anything like as awful as I'd expected. Aside from the boredom of isolation and no social contact, I didn't experience any of the typical nasty Covid symptoms many others I know had experienced like taste loss, tiredness, continuous coughing or fever. All I got was a snuffle, dry throat and enough infection for a consistently positive lateral flow tests result through all nine days and beyond.

It's been well over a year since I spoke at a conference virtually, and more than three since I've done anything in-person. Hopeful to make a return at some point in the not too distant future!

Until next week folks, when I should hopefully be in the clear Covid-wise and also in DÃ¼sseldorf ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª for (link: https://events.indieweb.org/2022/04/indiewebcamp-d%C3%BCsseldorf-ht968fpXyhij text: IndieWebCamp), (link: https://accessibility-club.org/ text: Accessibility Club) and (link: https://beyondtellerrand.com/ text: Beyond Tellerrand), stay safe and free of Covid if you possibly can folks!
