This will be a collaborative session in which we plan out and discuss ways to improve the user experience of existing websites through progressively enhancing them to become comparable to a native app, or even, better than a native app!

I'll be introducing some common characteristics of PWAs such as:

* **Availabilty** offline/poor quality connections (utilising ServiceWorkers)
* **Discoverability** in search engines (via Manifest)
* **Re-engagement** through push notifications
* **Installability** adding a home screen icon

A few topics of conversation that might arise from this process could include:

* To what extent do the UI features of your PWA match those of the user's platform versus a separately designed UI?
* Should you convert the entire website into a PWA or keep a separate version to serve desktop users?
* What UI features of native apps would you like *...and could feasibly incorporate into a PWA*?

**I hope from this session that together we learn what benefits, limitations and challenges there are in designing PWAs.**
