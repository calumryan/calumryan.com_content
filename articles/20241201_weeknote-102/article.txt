- At the beginning of the week I was meant to be in Dublin for a short city break. Alas, our outbound flight fell victim to Storm Bert in being cancelled the night before. We were offered an alternative flight the following day, but one night in Dublin isn't really enough, so we decided to cancel. After some lengthy time in a call queue to BA, I managed to get a full refund for the flights at least.
- To cheer us up after having our trip cancelled at the last minute, we went for a hearty Brazilian brunch in Tooting Market on Sunday at (link: https://www.tastefactoryuk.com/ text: TasteFactory).
- Monday we enjoyed a visit to the cinema together with my mum to see Small Things Like These. A brilliant performance by Cillian Murphy. It's a sad film, for sure, but presented in such a delicate and beautiful way.
- Tuesday lunchtime we returned to one of our favourite Peruvian restaurants in London, Se√±or Ceviche.
- I spent the afternoon exploring the V&A with my mum, who'd come down originally mainly for the reason to look after Bagheera, our cat. We went to see the Harry Styles Cardigan on display. My mum recently knitted a recreation over many hours of said cardigan as a present for Ximena.
- Thursday I was back in the office and dropped by at the (link: https://bsky.app/profile/imhuyorks.bsky.social/post/3lbzn6g26222y text: Design Systems Day Hackathon (Opens post on BlueSky)). There were lots of brilliant folks there from across the public sector, and the activity theme focused on linking design systems.
