Title: Weeknote 104

Text:

- Work has been slowly winding down towards the Christmas holidays. There's talk of more rebranding for GDS and some big changes to how our teams are grouped together.
- Friday, Mena and I went for pizza at a new find in Stoke Newington, (link: https://www.vicolidinapoli.co.uk/ text: Vicoli di Napoli Pizzeria). The service was prompt and friendly, and the pizzas were genuinely authentic Napoli style.
- Over the weekend Bagheera the cat moved in with me. We took her from her North London home so that I can take care of her while Mena visits Chile over Christmas and New Year. Bagheera experienced her first train ride with surprising ease, showing no signs of anxiety, and seemed to enjoy it. She's previously stayed in my home and so quickly settled in.
- Getting into the Christmas mood, I've baked my first batch of mince pies and dusted off a couple of Christmas jumpers in my wardrobe ready for my final working week of 2024.
