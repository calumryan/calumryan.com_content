Title: Weeknote 105

----

Text:

- On Monday evening, I went to Heathrow T5 to see Mena off on her month-long trip to Chile. Unfortunately, I couldn't join her this time due to work commitments, but hopefully next Christmas. The atmosphere was cheerful, with people heading to exotic destinations for the festive season. I stopped by my favourite spot in Caf√© Nero at departures landside for some plane and people watching.
- My final week at work of 2024 was fairly quiet, just with some preparation of my objectives ahead of the next quarter. On Friday, one of my colleagues gave a detailed and inspiring presentation about her career in design.
- I've completed a full year of learning Chilean-Spanish with my online tutor. While I'm still not fluent in Spanish, I feel somewhat more confident than I did a year ago. My favourite topics to discuss in Spanish so far are food, travel, and pets, as I find them the easiest to talk about. Next year, I may challenge myself to start writing some notes here in Spanish, provided I can figure out how to make them accessible for screen readers.
- Bagheera the cat has been settling back into my home and making sure I wake up bright and early, usually no later than 5 am.
