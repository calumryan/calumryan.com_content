Title: Weeknote 100

Text:

- Albeit with some gaps of one or two weeks, I've finally made it to my 100th Weeknote since starting in 2022 ðŸŽ‰
- Wednesday morning was grim and dreary in many respects and not just because of the seemingly unending grey overcast weather here in the UK this autumn/winter. The result of the US Election didn't really come to me as a surprise, but nevertheless still coming to terms with it being the grim reality now for next four years.
- What somewhat took my mind of the grimness, was giving a presentation to an online audience at (link: https://openuk.uk/community/meetup/ text: OpenUK Meetup) about my IndieWeb journey along with (link: https://ohhelloana.blog/ text: Ana). It felt as much a fun journey to tell for me, as for my audience to listen, thinking back over the 25 years since I first connected to the internet and shortly after published something on the web.
- Thanks to the poor weather and limited daylight hours, I've not been out on my bicycle for over two weeks now and likely that isn't helping me release some feel-good endorphins. Though I did go for a short lunchtime jog in the week, I struggle to enjoy jogging quite like I enjoy and feel the urge to go cycling.
- I headed up to Crewe at the weekend to join my folks to see (link: https://www.nedboulting.com/ text: Ned Boulting)'s latest theatre show about the Tour de France. It was a thoroughly captivating show as with his previous shows and all the more touching with a story about a lesser known cyclist in the (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avp72imh6D4 text: 1923 Tour captured in this video (opens in YouTube)) that Ned recovered through an auction. Certainly his best show yet.
- Whilst up north I also visited an old favourite cafÃ© of mine for lunch, The Green, in the nearby village of Bollington.  The stereotypical northern rural/post-industrial area has since become all the more posh and wealthy following Manchester's boom in recent years. There we enjoyed a pleasant stroll along the old railway there which would be all the more scenic and pleasant in summer.
