Title: Weeknote 43

Just a short one this week, part way through my visit to Bucharest.

## Bis bald Düsseldorf!
The week began with my time spent mostly at Beyond Tellerrand conference in Düsseldorf. Once again a great event with such a great range of speakers, and the company of many familiar people I’ve known for many years from across Germany and beyond. I also met up with my good friend Dave Letorey, organiser of State of the Browser in London, who’d never been to btconf before.

## Salut Bucharest!
After a short hop to Dortmund airport on the train from Düsseldorf, I made my way to Bucharest for my first ever visit there with X. The flight with Wizz Air was just about bearable for the two-hour duration. I’d not been feeling well, and the cramped seating, plus restless kids in the neighbouring seats, didn’t help make for a relaxing flight.

Some ups and downs so far staying in Bucharest, but mainly all positive experiences, including good food. More news next week!
