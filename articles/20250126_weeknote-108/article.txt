Title: Weeknote 108

----

Text:

- Weeknote-ing this week with news that I might require some surgery following an appointment at the hospital last week, pending a CT scan for investigation, which is thankfully only a couple of months away.
- At work, it was unusually a full-house in the Whitechapel office on Tuesday. Peter Kyle, our Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology came in to launch the new GDS to the press. 
- I'd come in to the office to help run demos to the press of the accessibility lab, which attracted just two passers-by. Pretty much all the attention was however on the innovations in GOV.UK's mobile app and GOV.UK Chat.
- Thursday I travelled over to the extremities of West London to once again attend an event at Brunel University. 
- The Brunel Design School invited me, along with other alumni, to advise students on their projects and future career plans. I enjoyed spending four hours of my evening providing advice on accessibility-related matters and participating in a feedback session with the tutors afterward.
