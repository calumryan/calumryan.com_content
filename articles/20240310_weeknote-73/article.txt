- A year has passed since I moved to Wimbledon, although it doesn't feel like it! The mostly wet weather here this weekend was almost identical to how things were when I moved from Kent a year ago.
- Early on Thursday morning I headed to Brighton for (link: https://patternsday.com/ text: Patterns Day). A splendid time was had, and I've more on that to say in a separate post.
- Ahead of (link: https://indieweb.org/ text: IndieWebCamp) over the weekend I stayed in Brighton and spent some time working there at a gorgeous Airbnb as well work in one of its many great coffee shops.
- I discovered a new-ish Mexican caf√© in Brighton with delicious tacos for lunch. Highly recommend a visit to (link: https://casazul.co.uk/ text: Casa Azul Taqueria) located in the Open Market.
- (link: https://calumryan.com/notes/3684 text: Ten years on from my first IndieWebCamp) in 2014 I attended once again. There were around 30 in attendance this year that I was pleasantly surprised by. It was great to be back in Brighton and see familiar faces as well as meet quite a few new community members.
