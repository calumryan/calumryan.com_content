Thanks to [Aaron Parecki](https://github.com/indieweb/mention-client-php) sharing his client library for sending webmentions I have now setup an initial interface to send out webmentions from my website.

In the interim to support both the Jekyll side and LAMP setup parts of my website; I have implemented a separate source and target form to manually send out webmentions. Notes (or short posts) that you see on the homepage currently include a separate section for HTML encoded content. Here I store the relevant code to identify posts as a reply, like or RSVP to another websiteâ€™s content.

I have yet to enhance the response data into a digestible format from sending a webmention and also need to create the interface and functionality for removing webmentions.
