Title: Weeknote 67

----

Text:

- Dark, cold, damp winter is well and truly up on us, even here in the milder microclimates of London.
- For 2024 I've decided to change the format of these posts to short listed notes rather than a lengthy journal format which I often struggle to put together on a weekly basis.
- On TV streaming, I caught up with (link: https://www.itv.com/watch/mr-bates-vs-the-post-office/10a0469/10a0469a0001 text: Mr Bates vs The Post Office). An upsetting and harrowing watch about something I never thought would be such a devastating and horrific ongoing cover-up in Fujitsu and the UK's Post Office.
- Also binge rewatched a series Race Across The World with Ximena who'd not seen it before. This was the 2019 series that went from Mexico City all the way south to Ushuaia in Argentina through Latin America. Eagerly awaiting this year's new series.
- Return to work has been fairly quiet so far but I'm pushing for more inclusive usability testing in the team.
- I'm restarting Spanish lessons with a different tutor. This time with one who's based in Chile to hopefully get a better understanding of the differences in Chilean Spanish.
