Title: Weeknote 96

- Midweek at GDS I attended the London office to see a selection of Matt Lamont's graphic design collection followed by a talk he gave about his work and inspirations including (link: https://designreviewed.com/ text: Design Reviewed).
- Making the most of the dwindling daylight afterwork, I joined Luis for cycling round a very dark but empty Richmond Park. By the end of the ride my new powerful Canyon front light was proving its costly price tag well. Sadly, just two more weeks until the clocks go back and long dark evenings return – I never get used to them!
- On Sunday I joined Luis again for the first train out of Clapham Junction, Winchester bound at 8am for some countryside cycling. We covered about 30 miles (48 km) on our ride, passing many a thatched cottage, mistakenly hit a dead-end inside a health spa resort and passed by Waitrose supermarket's Leckford Estate. All in all a decent ride despite being rather cool and the lack of any sunshine. Winchester now has its own cycling cafe, (link: https://www.southdownssocial.com/ text: The South Downs Social), full of vintage replica cycling posters and a good choice of food plus coffee.
- Annoyed at myself for not browsing earlier the films on show at this year's BFI London Film Festival. Most of the things I want to see are already sold out or screened last week. Noted an Irish film, (link: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14186876/ text: Bring Them Down), with Barry Keoghan that'll hopefully be available on the BFI Player later.
- Not ashamed to say I love eating breads of all kinds and origins, so when Ximena made Chilean Dobladitas for the weekend accompanied by avocado, I was delighted!
