Title: Weeknote 103

Text:

- Last week I started preparing my apartment for Christmas, including my artificial tree that's beginning to fall apart in its ninth year, but still passes for looking quite realistic.
- Wednesday I joined Ximena for a Japanese dinner at (link: https://www.necco.london/ text: n√©cco) which nicely filled us up ahead of going to a performance of Swan Lake at Sadler's Well.
- Thursday was the GDS Design Team's away day, which took place in the London office rather than Bristol as originally planned and to take place back in early autumn. The creative element of the day included summarising our year as a piece of art. It was out with the Pritt Stick, coloured tissue paper and scissors for the exercise and I just about managed to throw together a collage in the short space of time we'd to create something. 
- Indoor bowling at the end of the away day was fun, I scored 76 point which was sadly far short of our bowling team's winning bowler, Tom. He beat everyone else in the Design Team with a high score of 123.
- Friday I headed West to Brunel University on the Elizabeth Line to attend the brand launch of the twentieth (link: https://madeinbrunel.com/ text: Made in Brunel). Whilst there, I bumped in to a couple of my lecturers who still work there. It brought back happy memories of my time there and to see how much the campus has changed since I graduated from there in 2011. Watch this space for more work/university-related activity in the New Year.
