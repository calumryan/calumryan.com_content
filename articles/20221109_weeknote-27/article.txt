## Property news
Hesitantly, I announce the news that I've found a new home in South West London. After three weeks of dithering and or forgetfulness from the seller, my offer was finally accepted. Three months or more, who knows, of probable house sale stress and uncertainty awaits!

## Furniture shop adventures

I'm continuing to post most of what I have to say and share there from my website. I've yet to fall in love with Mastodon, it's a hell of a complex platform to understand for many not involved in tech. I'm currently on the (link: https://toot.cafe/web/@calumryan text: toot.cafe) instance, but tempted to try another instance since it's often painfully slow to use.
