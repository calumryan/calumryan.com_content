Earlier this month this bright and colourful book arrived through my letterbox. It's author, [Amy Lockwood](https://twitter.com/AmieNLockwood), set out to do something different from the typical run of the mill children’s book awash with gender stereotyped characters and lack of inclusivity. The result is a great 15 minute read that’s delightfully illustrated and presented.

The reason I received this book was because I contributed in a small way to its funding on Kickstarter. Some years back following my attendance to Handheld Conference in Cardiff I became familiar through Twitter with Amy and found out about the crowdfunding-based project Alex the Brave. It’s the first time I’ve contributed to a project through Kickstarter and despite a long patient wait; I’m relieved and glad it’s finally happened.

Take a look for yourself at [Alex the Brave](https://liongirlpublishing.com/).
