Title: Weeknote 82

----

Text:

- It was another somewhat tiring and stressful week bringing together research from design and tech people on my current project with GDS in order to attempt to map a journey for my prototyping.
- Just over a year since my move to Wimbledon and unfortunately I seem to have fallen victim to my first parcel theft from the mailroom. Alas the CCTV was out of angle to capture who might have taken my parcel.
- Over the weekend I joined Ximena for a city break in Vienna. It was my third visit to the Austrian capital but still plenty new things for us both to see including the Hofburg Palace and Hundertwasserhaus.
- Flights to and from by Wizz Air were quite heavily delayed by an hour or more but otherwise decent considering this airline's recent reputation.
- Our visit to Vienna also provided the opportunity to try out some of the local cuisine in generous sized portions at restaurants Centimetre II, Kaffee Alt and Bier & Bierli. We also came across a Peruvian restaurant near the main station which had great ceviche and tranquil outdoor dining space at Lima 56.
