Title: Weeknote 84

----

Text:

- Returning to my weeknotes writing after a few weeks on pause
- I've had quite an exhausting few weeks finishing up on a working in a team and project which I wasn't enjoying much.
- Tuesday was my last day at dxw, so I went into the London office for leaving drinks with a few colleagues from my current and past teams there.
- **With that, I have big news that I joined GDS full-time last week as a Senior Accessibility Specialist. Hello Civil Service!**
- Whilst I'm sad to be leaving such a lovely bunch of folks at dxw, I am excited about having some significant change in my life and taking up a dedicated role in accessibility that I've aspired to for many years.
- So far just easing in to the role with lots of induction meetings and Civil Service docs to read through.
- At the weekend I joined Mena for lunch in Camden and a relaxing stroll along the Regents Canal to Paddington.
- Unfortunately, I'm suffering a little lower-back pain from riding my new racer bike which I've been out on for a few medium-distance rides so far.
- I'm hopeful a professional bike-fit next weekend might help answer whether a simple height adjustment is needed or, worst-case scenario, selling and replacing it with a bike that's less aggressive in design üò¢.
- Happy to see Tour de France back on TV this weekend as it rolled out of beautiful Florence and then into Bologna on Sunday.
- With the UK general election next week, I'm mildly optimistic of some more positive changes on the horizon ü§ûüèª. I'm for the first time in my adult life living in a marginal constituency, so hopefully my vote will make a difference!
