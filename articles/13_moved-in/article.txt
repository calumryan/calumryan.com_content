After eight months of feeling in a state of limbo, waiting on an onward property chain which broke three times, I’m now in my new home in the Garden of England: Kent. This has been a significant step in my life with much planning, budgeting and some degree of anxiety over future plans.

Looking ahead it will be a physically challenging period training as much as I can in the lead up to [Velothon Wales](http://www.velothon-wales.co.uk/en/) - where I’ll be attempting the full 140km route amongst vast numbers of other cyclists.
