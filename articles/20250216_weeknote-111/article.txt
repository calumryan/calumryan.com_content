Title: Weeknote 111

----

Text:

- Still in Barcelona until Tuesday last week, I managed to fit in plenty more places to visit and dine in there. 
- Monday, I was lucky enough to visit the Palau de la Musicá for a guided tour during a rehearsal. What a remarkable building it is from top to bottom.
- I discovered some more Chilean restaurants in Barcelona's less touristy areas and enjoyed a set menu, although sadly Pastel de Choclo wasn't included and somewhat wished I went for that instead.
- Nearby, I ascended part of the hill towards Montjuïc Castle only to catch the wrong bus that took me straight back down the hill. Thankfully it was a circular bus route, so I just stayed onboard, and finally I reached the castle via another bus. 
- After paying the 12 Euro entry fee for the castle, I felt it was worth it for the unique viewpoints across Barcelona.
- I concluded my last full day in Barcelona with a visit to the seafront for a large pan of paella.
- Of course, no trip there could be complete without a visit to La Sagrada Família. It was predictably busy but took my time to see round all corners and, now, towers accessible via a lift. 
- The flight home was smooth and on time, albeit the two passengers behind me had an almighty fit of coughing and sneezing throughout the flight without any attempt to cover themselves and protect others from infection.
- Predictably, a couple of days later I developed flu-like symptoms and since spent the weekend sofa/bedbound and feeling pretty awful.
