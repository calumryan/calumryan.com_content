Title: Weeknote 113

- Today marks two years since I made the move to Wimbledon. Initially, I was a bit worried that downsizing to a one-bedroom apartment might be challenging, but over time, I’ve managed to utilise the space more efficiently without feeling cramped. I’ve reached a stage where I feel my apartment has everything I need, without the desire to invest in additional furniture or make further interior changes. Of course, having a larger space someday would be great, but given the current housing market and my budget, it's not financially feasible.
- Sunday morning, I joined my friend Luis for a cycle ride out to Esher and coffee at Giro. We hadn't caught up in three months, so there was plenty to talk about, including our planned trip to watch Le Tour in Lille this summer.
- We were lucky to enjoy a brief taste of warm summer weather this weekend, so I made the most of being outdoors, including a light lunch at (link: https://www.wearebonbon.co.uk text: bonbon Fulham).
- Bagheera the cat is enjoying her life back in North London with Mena, especially now that she has a garden to enjoy. She has a special fondness for the stylish garden chairs Mena purchased recently, which offer the ideal spot for sunbathing and doubling as a lookout post to keep an eye on the neighbor's cat, Moon, her sworn nemesis.
- You know summer is near in London when the city fills with the chaotic symphony of stolen Lime bikes—beeping, clicking, and weaving unpredictably on streets and pavements. It’s high time they were replaced with tamper-proof models and offered at more affordable rental prices, in my opinion!
