Title: Weeknote 90

Text:

- Two months in to my new role at GDS I'm gradually seeing my workload begin to increase and generally finding that accessibility knowledge is good among the different teams.
- Finding a good balance between working from home and commuting in to the office for a couple of days each week when I can. The nearby street food market has a fair few options for lunch, though often very busy, so occasionally head over to Brick Lane Food Hall which has a decent stall inside for arepas.
- Mid-week I went to see Jake Lambert perform a work-in-progress at (link: https://www.alwaysbecomedy.com/ text: Always Be Comedy). Pretty good for a £7 ticket but felt some material needed a little more refining and not helped by some rather drunk audience members.
- On Saturday I headed west with my bike on the train out of Paddington towards Maidenhead and enjoyed a short ride through pretty Berkshire countryside over to (link: https://velolifecafes.com/velolife/ text: Velolife café) beside the Thames at Wargrave. Felt good to be back on the bike in quiet countryside lanes!
- Sticking with the waterside theme, Sunday I joined Ximena for a delicious roast lunch alongside the Regent's Canal at Islington's (link: https://www.thenarrowboatpub.com/ text: Narrowboat). Summer was back with full sunshine and heat just for the first day of September.
- For my TV viewing habits of recent, I've been dividing time between the Paralympics and catching up with La Vuelta on Eurosport. Looking forward to the Tour of Britain back next week, albeit shorter than in previous years.
