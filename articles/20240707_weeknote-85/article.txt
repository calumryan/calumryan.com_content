Title: Weeknote 85

Text:

- Finally, finally, finally, we have a Labour government for the second time in my life following the General Election on Thursday. Hopeful, things start to get better, well at least no worse than before.
- The Champions of Accessibility Network had their first in-person meet this year in London. I made it along to the Southbank to chat with accessibility folks and watch some talks.
- Saturday I'd my bike fit which went better than hoped for. I'd my cleats and handlebars adjusted, plus a new saddle. All that should hopefully reduce pressure and consequential pain on my lower back.
- The weather conditions haven't provided much opportunity for cycling sadly, where did summer go?
- Continuing to follow highlights of Le Tour on ITV this week. A spectacular performance by Mark Cavendish in achieving 35 stage wins, the most ever won by a rider in the history of Le Tour.
- There's a sushi takeaway that's recently reopened down the road from me, which we tried at the weekend. Not quite the divine taste of Chilean sushi, but nevertheless very good and reasonably priced.
