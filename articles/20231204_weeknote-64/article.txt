## Wet and gloomy
There's little to report over the past fortnight's predictably wet and gloomy start to British meteorological winter here in SW19. Mostly I've been in hibernation mode, occasionally pushing myself to do a few virtual miles of cycling on Zwift or walk round the block. I made a brief outing to London's Transport Museum last weekend to see the new exhibition on poster design. It was busy at the museum, predictably full of noisy, undisciplined kids running about. Thankfully, they stayed away from the poster exhibition!

## TV audience
Once again, I drew lucky for two tickets to watch The Last Leg live at Television Centre in Shepherds Bush, so took a friend.  It was just about worth the compulsory two-hour wait outside in freezing conditions to get a good seat in the audience. Granted, we don't have to pay to get in, but I do wish the BBC would provide a better audience waiting area for what must be one of the most iconic TV studios globally.

## Three weeks to Christmas
My compact and carefully packed eight-year old Christmas tree is once again up and looking like new in its new home, fitting in perfectly by the balcony window of my small apartment. I'm holding out a week or two until I resurface my recipe for baking mince pies. This will be after I've returned from a flying solo visit to Dublin this weekend coming, to hopefully stock up on some more Irish Branded Tea plus other uniquely Irish groceries.
