## Barbenheimer
Over the past two weekends I joined X in a one-week spread film binge to see the latest blockbuster film releases, Barbie and Oppenheimer. Rarely do I go to the cinema on the day of a film's release, and it was predictably a challenge finding cinemas that weren't entirely sold out. I'd give both films about an 8 out of 10 overall. Barbie was cheery and fun to watch, although as we used to say, I won't be rushing out to buy the DVD! For the full experience watching Oppenheimer we went to the local IMAX cinema where sound levels weren't the best with the almost constant background music a little overwhelming. Nevertheless, the overall direction and acting was exemplary.

## Celebrations
Last week was X's graduation ceremony from King's College London which I attended at the Royal Festival Hall along with some of her family. I was reminded somewhat of my own graduation 12 years ago which was in the somewhat less grand venue of Brunel University's indoor athletics centre. We'd a celebratory dinner later in the day at Sketch London where I'd the scallops for starter, a red mullet main and dessert of raspberry mousse. A rather unusual highlight of the visit was going upstairs to the restroom toilet pods, which were more than anything else a hive for Instagramers to show off their latest discovery.

We also went for a second celebratory dinner of a different kind the following day at Elephant Castle's Sabor Peruano. A very down-to-earth restaurant, and the Papa a la Huancaína was the best I tried yet! We'll definitely be back here at some point.

## Meeting at GDS
The previous week I'd been to meet my new team at work in the Government Digital Service offices at Whitechapel in London. We'd a good time getting to know each other, including drawing peculiar creatures as part of our team-bonding exercise. The office itself is high above the streets of Central London, affording a great view across The City's landmarks, and toward Crystal Palace tower.
