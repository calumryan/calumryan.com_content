Title: Weeknote 71

----

Text:

- Work has been moderately busy with some small accessibility tasks coming over from my old team to keep me busy until I'm allocated a project to work on full-time.
- I rarely buy new shoes but this week I received my first pair of new Camper shoes. It's a brand I've never tried before and so far rather impressed with the comfort and style that doesn't squash my toes together like most shoes do.
- The door frame of my trusty Bosch washing/drying machine of two years cracked last week, but luckily didn't cause a leak mid-cycle. The Web is thankfully now abundant with spare parts suppliers, where I was able to source a replacement without needing to replace the whole thing.
- Another weekend of railway and road closures here deterred me from venturing far, so I'd mostly a lazy weekend in cafés and walking the streets of Wimbledon's leafier neighbourhoods. 
- Having passed it many times on my way to Wimbledon Park station, I finally got round to trying a breakfast at (link: https://www.saucerandcup.com/ text: Saucer & Cup). Despite a little pricey, their avocado and poached egg toast was delish! Those of you here that know me well may be aware I don't particularly like eggs in a dish, but for a few exceptions where the egg's quantity and taste isn't very dominant.
- Estoy aprendiendo Español. My learning journey to have enough Spanish to get by on my trip to Chile next month continues and I'm feeling vaguely confident so far.
