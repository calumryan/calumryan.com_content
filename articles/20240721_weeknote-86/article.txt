Title: Weeknote 86

Text:

- Last weekend I made a trip north to visit my parents. Avanti Trains didn't fail in managing to be late both ways thanks to a combination of congestion and broken down freight trains. Sad to see the cancellation of all but the first leg of HS2 remaining in the new government's plans for transport.
- It was a welcome return of London Web Standards this past week, returning with a great line-up of past and new speakers in its new venue at Greenwich University.
- Finally I received my GovPass, so now I can use the office more often without requiring a booking and visitor escort. It's a rather long commute of about 60-70 minutes on the slow and crowded District Line, so not planning to go more than required.
- At work it's been announced we're changing government departments to Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT). Exciting in some respects, but somewhat dreading if we're forced to ditch our Macs for Windows and using Microsoft suite. Last week's big tech failure doesn't inspire confidence!
- Sad to see the finish of the Tour de France until another a year. Felt quite unusual not to have the race finishing in Paris but Nice and a time trial too. Congrats to Pogacar once again! Looking ahead to cycling at the Paris Olympics with some excitement.
- On my own bicycle, I managed a 60Â km roundtrip to Box Hill without pain, albeit a little stiffness in the back whilst I'm still getting used to the more aggressive position needed for my new bicycle.
