## Dental horrors
For over a decade, I'd visited my increasingly oversubscribed NHS dentist near my family home each year, which was quite a long and expensive trek for an increasingly shorter and less than comprehensive checkup. This week, I finally took the plunge into private dentistry following the alarming discovery that my mouth had rather resembled that of a vampire each time I went to brush my teeth for the past couple of weeks. My new private dentist discovered a large cavity, which of course left me with little option but to make a relatively large hole in my finances to get it filled. 

## Foodie discoveries
After a day of much brushing and flossing, I'd recovered enough from the strenuous trials of dental drilling to go out and eat delicious foods again. First up was a visit to Camden for Afghan street food at (link: https://2ladskitchen.co.uk/ text: Two Lads Kitchen). I'd the signature dish, an Afghan veggie wrap of smokey spinach, mashed chickpeas and a zingy secret green sauce. This was easily one of the best wraps I've eaten, step aside Tex-Mex burritos!

After that I'd still room for a fluffy mango chiffon cake at another new discovery, (link: https://www.kovapatisserie.com/ text: Kova Patisserie).

Closer to home, on Sunday I went to try out a new vegan caf√© in Tunbridge Wells for a brunch of paprika spiced tofu, black beans and spinach with avocado and potato rosti at (link: https://www.theplantbase.co.uk/ text: The Plant Base).

## Frameworks work
The team I'm on at work has been devoting time away from client work to find a suitable frontend framework. It's hoped this will help us all as a team to make websites using a more consistent approach, besides (link: https://design-system.service.gov.uk/ text: GOV.UK's Design System). A few days of technical research sped by, and I think few of us were fully decided on which approach was the ideal solution for the array of frameworks out there.
