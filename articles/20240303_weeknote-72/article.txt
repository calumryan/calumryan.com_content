Title: Weeknote 72

Text:

- With a little more time on my hands at work since the project I was on got paused/ran out of funding, I've resumed running accessibility workshops. Always a satisfying experience being able to impart my knowledge that's received with much appreciation from those I teach on a subject not widely taught.
- After some pleading, work finally sent me a speedy new Macbook Air M1 to replace my somewhat ageing and noisy Macbook Pro from 2020. Somewhat joyful I managed to peel off my favourite laptop sticker damage free and still with sufficient stickiness for transfer to the Air ðŸ˜„
- Midweek I dragged myself out for a free evening course in basic life-saving skills. The course leader was amazingly good at his job, a cheerful guy with plenty of laughter thrown in to teach an activity we all hope not to have to put in to practise often, if at all! It's a sad fact that the UK doesn't teach life-saving skills in schools, unlike the rest of Europe!
- On Sunday, making the most of the late winter sun, we took a stroll along The Thames from Barnes to Putney. It's a busy old stretch of the Thames Path to walk at weekends, but worth it for the views and cute dogs to spot.
