Title: Certified Web Accessibility Specialist

----

Text:

About a year ago, I decided to put my accessibility knowledge to the test and commit myself to months of preparation to take the exam for WAS (Web Accessibility Specialist) certification.

Ten years since...

I'm proud to join a select community of accessibility specialists of just 700 (approximately) and to have started my learning process on a strong foundation of knowledge which I will hopefully use and grow further on throughout my career working in the web industry.
