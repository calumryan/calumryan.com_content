## Christmas
The past couple of weeks leading up to Christmas were fairly quiet and avoidant of the shopping crowds. 

I managed to make a rare appearance at Homebrew Website Club Europe online. So glad to see it still going strong after over a year without me!

I spent some time exploring my local area. I'm a recent convert to dockless cycle hire in London, having started using Forest/River bikes which seem super cheap and in reasonably good condition compared to Lime bikes. After a short ride to nearby Putney, I walked a loop of the River Thames path to Hammersmith and back. Enroute, I stopped for brunch at Glasshouse Coffee. Good food and good coffee in the bright, calm surroundings of a garden centre.

Following that, I walked a little further towards Vue at Fulham to see the latest film release, Napolean. Aside from the film, which I rather enjoyed, I'd sadly to share my viewing experience with the typical clientele for Vue cinemas attracted by their relatively cheap tickets. I counted at least three people in front of me on their phones throughout the film.

I'd my first Christmas away from family and in SW19. The day was mainly spent indoors due to the relentless spells of rain in this part of the world. We'd a delicious roast duck for Christmas dinner homemade Calzones Rotes and on the 24th and then spent much of the Christmas Day eating leftovers, baking a delicious pan de pascua, and later streaming our favourite shows on catch-up TV.

## Seeing out 2023
That's about it for my weeknote writing of 2023. In the coming days I'll be looking back and writing up my thoughts on a year filled with new travel and food experiences I've had the pleasure of sharing with my partner.
