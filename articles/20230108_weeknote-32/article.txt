## First week in to 2023
Easing into the first week of the new year, my week began with a visit to The London Transport museum with X. My last visit there was almost thirty years ago, accessed with free admission thanks to my (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Peter_badge text: Blue Peter Badge). Alas, I paid for admission this time since I couldn't find the badge this time, plus I'm somewhat past the age of validity now! There's comfortably enough to see and explore within three hours, although I'm somewhat disappointed that much of the exhibition only seems to focus on buses and the Underground, rather than the entire range of transport modes London benefits from today.

## London eat outs and comedy
Turkish cuisine was the pick of the week for dining out at Hala, Harringey. Go here only if you've a big appetite, since the portions are generous! That said, the food was delicious, and I managed to finish both courses of filled aubergine for starters and main of grilled whole sea bass.

Later in the week, I joined a friend for Wolf and Owl Live, giving me a good reason to make my first ever visit to the Royal Festival Hall to watch something. Despite having never listened to the (link: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wolf-and-owl/id1540826523 text: Wolf and Owl podcast) before, I found it great fun in spite of one or two disruptive members of the audience shouting out humorless nonsense.

## Do like to be beside the seaside 
I made a beeline for the breezy coastline of Bexhill at the weekend in need of some fresh sea air, biryani at (link: https://www.facebook.com/desibitesdining/ text: Desi Bites) and a small helping of sea-themed art at the (link: https://www.dlwp.com/ text: De La War Pavilion) gallery. It's by far one of my favourite small free galleries in the UK, and Bexhill a seaside town that's rarely too crowded but still has a good vibe, with some decent shops and cafés.
