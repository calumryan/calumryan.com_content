Title: Weeknote 99

- It was time to turn back the analogue clocks, plus the microwave, last Sunday here in the UK, and with it the return of dwindling daylight hours. There was little to no sunlight this week to cheer the soul, just a lot of disturbing bangs nearby from fireworks being let off early.
- Sad to hear news on (link: https://neverstraysfar.com/ text: Never Strays Far) podcast that the organisers of Tour de France are giving exclusive broadcast rights to subscription-only Eurosport from 2026. It's a huge loss to the TV schedules that ITV won't broadcast it any more. ITV Cycling had a unique format that appealed to a much broader audience and no doubt encouraged cycling of all kinds for all ages.
- Also very sad to hear the passing of one of my favourite Scottish comedians at the weekend, (link: https://janeygodley.com/ text: Janey Godley).
- I'm preparing a presentation to give next week at a meetup online. It's been a while since I've prepared a presentation, although preparing one for my last job interview for GDS did help make this feel less daunting. I went to one of my favourite coffee shops, (link: https://doppiocoffee.co.uk/ text: Doppio), in Kentish Town to help get in the mood to prepare my slides.
- I'd to run a workshop on accessible social media at work last week. I felt like it went ok, but could probably have spent more time researching it and struggled to make it feel more interactive.
- I joined Ximena for Sunday Lunch at one of our favourite pubs near Alexandra Palace, (link: https://www.thestartinggate.co.uk text: The Starting Gate). It was super busy, but had a really comfy atmosphere. It was worth the wait for such delicious and well presented roasts!
- Awaiting with little hope from the result of this week's Presidential election across The Pond for a throwback to 2016.
