## Property survey woes
The dreaded words of ‚Äúpossible asbestos‚Äù came up on my survey more than enough times to comfortably ignore for the 1980s ex-housing association flat I'd intended to buy. Somewhat regrettably, I decided to withdraw my offer on the property last week. My plan B was swiftly implemented to offer under the asking price at a nearby pricey but new-ish build property still on the market with allocated parking and a balcony. Luckily, the offer was accepted! It's hopefully only a small set back in the house move progress, but overall I'm happier to be moving to a modern property that looks and feels like a place I feel I can happily one day call my home.

## London eats and reads
Over the weekend I ventured to North London and went for a divine three-course dinner at (link: https://www.tierraperu.co.uk/ text: Tierra Peru) accompanied by a zingy Pisco Sour. It's hard to pick a favourite out of the three courses, including Peruvian sweet potato fritters! ü§§, but the starter of Papa a la huanca√≠na definitely hit the spot in terms of flavours I'd never experienced anything like before.

Sunday brunch included a visit to Harringay's very popular (link: https://www.thedustyknuckle.com/ text: Dusty Knuckle) for coffee, fresh pastries and some of the best deep filled sandwiches London has to offer. I went for the roasted squash and Labneh cheese sandwich.

Meanwhile at home I've been reading my latest book purchase, London Feeds Itself, which is opening my mind to many interesting and undiscovered architecture and culinary spots in preparation for my move to the Big Smoke, hopefully early next year.

## Something good
I won't say more than this for now, but‚Ä¶ thanks to someone very special in my life recently, things are finally looking much better for me: I'm feeling more content, and having a positive outlook of life challenges and opportunities ahead, despite what horrible things may be happening in the World right now I have no control over.
