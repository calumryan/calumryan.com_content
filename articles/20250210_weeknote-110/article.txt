Title: Weeknote 110

----

Text:

- Work load is gradually ramping up with a full accessibility audit of the GOV.UK website. It's been a somewhat stressful experience so far coordinating with everyone.
- Friday I joined a friend to see David O'Doherty's new tour stopping off at Alexandra Palace. We both enjoyed it and I could particularly pick up some of the Irish references that half the audience of Brits couldn't so easily.
- Early Saturday I headed to Barcelona via Vueling airlines from Gatwick. Sorry to the environment, but the train alternative is far too long and expensive!
- It was refreshing to be travelling abroad again, my first trip since last June.
- I visited Casa Batlló on arrival after forking many more euros than I felt it was worth. Beautiful inside and out, but too crowded and disappointed by the limited access without paying yet more to reach the roof.
- Still in Barcelona for a couple more days so making the most of sunshine and mild temperatures before returning to grey grim climate of February London.
- More details next week...
