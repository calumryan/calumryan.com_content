Title: Weeknote 39

Text:

Hello friends and followers, it feels like no time ago that I started writing these (link: https://calumryan.com/articles/weeknote-1 text: weeknotes) just over a year ago! I don't always have the time or motivation to write every single week, but thank you to all of you who loyally come back to read these when I manage to publish something of slight interest.

## Coffee and food explorations
In search of good coffee shops locally, I tried a couple in my new locality this week. So far Bean & Hop fits the bill in terms of atmosphere and decent quality coffee, although I'm yet to sample its food offering. The 20-minute walk there from my new home along the River Wandle is a pleasant retreat from the busy roads of South West London.

Nearby, I also went with a friend to try Summertown's (link: https://figlidelvesuvio.com/ text: Figli Del Vesuvio) for an authentic Napolitano pizza… delish!

## Broadband woes
The past week I've been let down considerably by my new broadband provider, Community Fibre. Firstly, they installed a fibre connection to my apartment, but couldn't get a connection to the internet. They then pretty much ignored my case for days and mistakenly sent another installer a week later without the skills to solve the issue. Thankfully, I'm not without internet… yet! The previous owner of my apartment left behind their router with a few days remaining on their contract. Meanwhile, I'm not getting anywhere with Community Fibre's customer service, so swiftly looking at alternative internet providers.

## Cycling
Finding areas round here to cycle safely and free of motor traffic populated by mostly impatient, horn-honking addicted drivers is somewhat harder. I did however manage to navigate my way safely to Richmond Park via some half-decent cycle lanes out of Wimbledon and alongside the A3.
