Text:
Using Terminal or the command line to install anything is just great when things go smoothly however more often than not a certain dependency is missing or a recent update elsewhere has conflicted with whatever it is you were running perfectly fine before.

### And so to the issue
Upon trying to install/reinstall Jekyll I got this error message:

```ruby
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Errno::EPERM)
Operation not permitted - /usr/bin/jekyll
```

### Solution
The recent increased security changes in OS X El Capitan (called System Integrity Protection) now mean that in order to install Jekyll we need to explicitly specify a directory which isn't protected by this. The default location for installation is the Ruby > Gems directory however it's protected now. Therefore we specify a local directory:

```ruby
sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin jekyll
```

Likewise the same command can be used for installing other Ruby Gems where this problem occurs.
