Title: Weeknote 106

- Last Monday I decided to have a wander around bits of South London – taking in a walk round Elephant & Castle to see its rapid transformation in to a mini Manhattan. After that, I spent some time in Peckham and located a Hidden London listed eatery for lunch at (link: https://ryelanebagels.com/ text: Rye Lane Bagels). It was a long-ish wait despite a short queue, but worth it! I went for the smokey brisket bagel served with a generous dollop of melted cheese, which was an unhealthy treat for sure, but delish!
- For New Year’s Eve I nabbed some last minute tickets to see the theatre adaptation of Dr. Strangelove starring Steve Coogan. Albeit a production tailored to the West End and to attract a broad range of tastes, I still found the performance to my liking for the most part. Later that evening I saw in the New Year with my neighbour, friends, and Coco the dog.
- New Year's Day was pretty much a write-off to go anywhere hear due to heavy rain all day. I stayed in and caught up with some reading, YouTube channels and films.
- The following two days of the New Year were pleasantly clear, albeit cool. I headed south to Portsmouth on the train and spent a relaxing Thursday meandering round Portsmouth and Southsea, including a visit to the city museum.
- Friday I ventured north towards Bushey near Watford to visit Vincenzo's Pizza. Anyone familiar with their reels on Instagram by social media food influencers will know about them. I ordered a couple of their most popular pizzas for takeaway and decided to have them alfresco. An 8 out of 10 in my opinion for this New York/Neapolitan fusion-style pizza, but my favourite still remains authentic Neapolitan-style pizza from Streatham-based Bravi Ragazzi.
