Title: Columbia es pasi√≤n!

----

Review: Being a self-confessed fan of cycling, this book was a must-read! Matt Rendell gives great insight into Columbia's significance on the world stage as a contributor to champions in the professional cycling world who've started their lives from very little, and experience great hardship and danger along the way. The lives of each Colombian cyclist is piece by piece studied with political and cultural context.
