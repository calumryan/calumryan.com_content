Title: South from Granada

----

Review: This classic of a read provides an insight in to rural Andalusia in the 1920s, capturing the nature of rural Spanish life.  Personally this wasn't a read I enjoyed greatly. Brenan's perspective of the country comes from one of great privilege and a degrading attitude to women.
