Title: Townscapes

----

Review: In this book Burke shows what could, and what should, become of our towns from an architectural and social perspective. Though this was written in 1970s, it makes for an interesting retrospective for how our towns and cities have evolved over time with preservation, but also, unjust destruction in equal measure.
